Combine and minify enqueued CSS and JavaScript files for SEO (site speed).

I wrote this plugin, because I tried several plugins promised to minify and combine my resources.
Unfortunately non of them did that without JavaScript and/or CSS errors.
This plugin still in early phase, I will do more tests and probably make a few corrections as well.

DESCRIPTION
-----------

<b>External CSS and JavaScript files will be ignored.</b> <br />
I think, plugin and theme developers use CDN (or other external soruce) for a reason.

<b>jQuery and jQuery migrate will be also ignored.</b> <br />
Some plugin and theme developers sometimes enqueue they JavaScript and CSS files in the footer
and in this case, those scripts are enqueued very late, they can not be catched earlier. If jQuery
has processed, could cause depency issues.

<b>Process JavaScript and CSS file automatically</b> if no exist or one of the resource file is modified
based on the last modified time.

Convert relatvie url('../..') src-s to absolute in css files.

<b>The plugin has two methods:</b>

* First method work with the enqueued list from WordPress, it can be also done, to process the source code
after output buffering, but sometimes plugin and theme developers use a conditional to enqueue resources
only on some pages. In this case, the plugin will be run every time on the different page,
and that would be more time, what we otherwise gain,

* Second method process the HTML source after WordPress render them and before sent to browser. It will create a separate Css/JS file for each page, make sure, all "in the footer" enqueued scripts are correctly processed. This method uses PHP DomDocument DOM Parser and Output Buffering.

NOTE
----

Methode 1:
    The combined JavaScript file will be enqueued in the footer. This could cause depency issues, if some
    very late enqueued JavaScript file has an earlier JavaScript depency. I think, this is very rear, you could
    remove the file via <code>exopite-combiner-minifier-skip-wp_scripts</code> filter. (You could use as <code>array( 'jquery', ... )</code>)

SUPPORT/UPDATES/CONTRIBUTIONS
-----------------------------

If you use my program(s), I would **greatly appreciate it if you kindly give me some suggestions/feedback**. If you solve some issue or fix some bugs or add a new feature, please share with me or mke a pull request. (But I don't have to agree with you or necessarily follow your advice.)<br/>
**Before open an issue** please read the readme (if any :) ), use google and your brain to try to solve the issue by yourself. After all, Github is for developers.<br/>
My **updates will be irregular**, because if the current stage of the program fulfills all of my needs or I do not encounter any bugs, then I have nothing to do.<br/>
**I provide no support.** I wrote these programs for myself. For fun. For free. In my free time. It does not have to work for everyone. However, that does not mean that I do not want to help.<br/>
I've always tested my codes very hard, but it's impossible to test all possible scenarios. Most of the problem could be solved by a simple google search in a matter of minutes. I do the same thing if I download and use a plugin and I run into some errors/bugs.
